## Magento Version Support
| Module Version | Magento Version |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| v1.x           | v2.2.x          |
| v0.1.x         | v2.1.x          |

#### Accept.js and Test mode
Test Mode requires your checkout and admin pages use the HTTPS protocol even
in your staging development environments. The correct version of Accetp.js,
https://jstest.authorize.net/v1/Accept.js, is loaded when the module is in test
mode, but it will error if you attempt to use it over HTTP. You do NOT need a
valid SSL certificate for testing.
