The <strong>Wishbone chair was designed in 1950 by Hans Wegner</strong>. The curved hind legs and the semicircular top rail together with the elegant Y-back endows the chair with a gracious and welcoming air. The wishbone sits well, is spacious and allows its user to easily change position. The back offers good support and most people feel comfortable in it for longer periods of time. The curved top rail makes it easy to move around and arm rests are long enough to give adequate support to your forearms - the chair can also be pushed in close to a table. Today, the Y-chair has developed into one of Wegner's and Carl Hansen's most popular chairs.</p>
